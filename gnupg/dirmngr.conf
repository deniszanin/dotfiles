# PRIVACY CONCERN CONFIGURATION FILE
#
# This is an implementation of the GnuPG: Using the GNU Privacy Guard official doc.
# Source: https://gnupg.org/documentation/manuals/gnupg.pdf
#
# Combined also with an obsolete version of gpg.conf from @ioerror:
#
# This is an implementation of the Riseup OpenPGP Best Practices
# Source: https://help.riseup.net/en/security/message-security/openpgp/best-practices
#
# IMPORTANT NOTE
#
# This GnuPG configuration file is a updated version from @ioerror's file
# found over Internet and in Riseup OpenGPG guide. 
#
# @ioerror's file is obsolute and cannot be used anymore due to changes in
# GnuPG options.
#
# Why to create dirmngr.conf file?
#
# DOC.: Since version 2.1 of GnuPG, dirmngr takes care of accessing the OpenPGP keyservers.
# As with previous versions it is also used as a server for managing and downloading 
# certificate revocation lists (CRLs) for X.509 certificates, downloading X.509 
# certificates, and providing access to OCSP providers. Dirmngr is invoked internally
# by gpg, gpgsm, or vi the gpg-connect-agent tool.
#
# WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO
#
# - Copy gpg.conf and dirmngr.conf files to your $HOME_DIR/.gnupg
# - Uncomment and type your default key in the 'default-key' option (in gpg.conf file).
# - Have a close look to all options available here and do change to your needs.
# - Don't trust this configuration file.
#
# - Use TOR?
# - Make changes to THIS FILE.

#-----------------------------
# behavior
#-----------------------------

# DOC.: The option '--use-tor' switches Dirmngr and thus GnuPG into Tor mode to route 
# all network access via Tor (an anonymity network). Certain other features are disabled
# in this mode. The effect of '--use-tor' cannot be overridden by any other command or
# even by reloading dirmngr. The use of '--no-use-tor' disables the use of Tor.
# The default is to use Tor if it is available on startup or after reloading dirmngr.
use-tor

# DOC.: Disable the use of all IPv6 addresses.
disable-ipv6

# DOC.: In 'Tor mode' Dirmngr uses a public resolver via Tor to resolve DNS names.
# If the default public resolver, which is 8.8.8.8 (Google), shall not be used a 
# different one can be given using this option. Note that a numerical IP address 
# must be given (IPv6 or IPv4) and that no error checking is done for ipaddr.
nameserver 1.1.1.1 1.0.0.1

#-----------------------------
# keyserver
#-----------------------------

# This is the server that --recv-keys, --send-keys, and --search-keys will
# communicate with to receive keys from, send keys to, and search for keys on
#
# DOC.: Use NAME as your keyserver. This is the server that gpg communicates with
# to receive keys, send keys and search for keys. The format of the NAME is a URI:
# 'scheme:[//]keyservername[:port]' The scheme is the type of keyserver: 'hkp' for
# the HTTP (or compatible) keyservers, 'ldap' for the LDAP keyservers, or 'mailto' 
# for the Graff email keyservers. Note that your particular installation of GnuPG
# may have other keyservers types available as well. Keyservers schemes are case-
# insensitive. After the keyserver name, optional keyserver configuration options
# may be provided. These are the same as the '--keyserver-options' of gpg, but 
# apply only to this particular keyserver.
# Most keyservers synchronize with each other, so there is generally no need to 
# send keys to more than one server. The keyserver hkp://keys.gnupg.net uses round
# robin DNS to give a different keyserver each time you use it.
# If exactly two keyservers are configured and only one is a Tor hidden service 
# (.onion), Dirmngr selects the keyserver to use depending on whether Tor is 
# locally running or not. The check for a running Tor is done for each new 
# connection.
# If no keyserver is explicitly configured, dirmngr will use the built-in default 
# of hkps://hkps.pool.sks-keyservers.net
keyserver hkps://hkps.pool.sks-keyservers.net
keyserver hkps://keys.openpgp.org

# Use Tor?

# Provide a certificate store to override the system default
# Get this from https://sks-keyservers.net/sks-keyservers.netCA.pem
#
# DOC.: Use the root certificates in FILE for verification of the TLS certificates
# used with hkps (keyserver access over TLS). If the file is in PEM format a suffix
# of .pem is expected for FILE. This option may be given multiple times to add more
# root certificates. Tilde expansion is supported.
# If no 'hkp-cacert' directive is present, dirmngr will make a reasonable choice: if
# the keyserver in question is the special pool hkps.pool.sks-keyservers.net, it will
# use the budled root certificate for that pool. Otherwise, it will use the system CAs.
