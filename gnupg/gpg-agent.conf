# DOC.: Set the time a cache entry is valid to n seconds. The 
# default is 600 seconds. Each time a cache entry is accessed, the 
# entry’s timer is reset. To set an entry’s maximum lifetime, use 
# max-cache-ttl. Note that a cached passphrase may not evicted 
# immediately from memory if no client requests a cache operation.
# This is due to an internal housekeeping function which is only 
# run every few seconds.
